Very good game. Nice balance of base building and strategy. It’s has depth so any player can find a dynamic they enjoy and stick with it. If they want relatively easy mindless farming and building they can do that. If they want more difficult challenges there are challenging events and bunkers. 
I’ve been playing for over a year and am totally addicted and look forward to what’s new in every update. 
LDOE has something for everyone.
