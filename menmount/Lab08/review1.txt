Hello. So I love the game but I experienced some glitches. Especially around the crashed planes. I was able to check a few boxes and found some nice gear but all the suddenly, my character could no longer loot or attack. After running out and back in as well as trying to walk to nearby places, I could attack and grab items but not at the plane site. Of course through this ordeal, I lost the awesome soldier armor because a random wolf attacked and couldn't fight back. Can you please see about fixing this?

Also, on a side note, instead of completely rebuilding walls and building weapons from scratch, can you add a way to repair items for lesser resources (ex. 1 log to repair spear or 2 scrap metals and a iron ore for a sword)?
